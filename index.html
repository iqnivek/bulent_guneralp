    <h2>What Students Say</h2>
    <section class="narrow">
      <h3>Voice Lessons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <blockquote>Over the past 6 years, I have performed more than 600 concerts worldwide. Bulent helped me to lay the groundwork for a voice that is well-prepared to take on the rigors of the road as well as the discipline to expect the best out of myself each night. From warming up and warming down, to lifestyle and technique, Bulent's instruction has encouraged, motivated, and prepared me to maximize my singing career.</blockquote>
          <cite>Jon Ricci, lead singer of Lansdowne</cite>
        </li>
        <li>
          <blockquote>&hellip; As a tenor I had no idea how to sing the high notes. When I sang, they used to come out, but sounded tight, so I never got a part in an opera. Well, just in one lesson I vocalized to a high C with the knowledge he gave me. I actually, for the first time, knew how I did it. &hellip; I've never given up on my dream, at times I wanted to, but now Bulent has given me a new hope that hopefully within a year I can actually audition for a part in a opera. A dream come true.</blockquote>
          <cite>Fausto Di Ianne, tenor</cite>
        </li>
        <li>
          <blockquote>&hellip; Blending great clarity, passion, knowledge and warmth, he has provided me with the tools to dramatically enhance my vocal talents. Whether breathing, posture, legato, tone, control, phrasing or otherwise, Bulent is remarkably attentive, engaging and effective.</blockquote>
          <cite>Jack Volpe</cite>
        </li>
        <li>
          <blockquote>Bulent is a great teacher. He is very patient and consistent, and he is willing to work with you at whatever level you are. &hellip; In one lesson, I was able to fix a sound problem that I had, and had instant results.</blockquote>

      <h3>Piano Lessons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <blockquote>One of my daughters worked with Bulent on piano and enjoyed every minute. She looked forward to every lesson and felt compelled to learn more. Bulent always went above and beyond, working on technique and voice. &hellip; Bulent gave her the confidence through trust and play to feel comfortable with performing.</blockquote>

    <h2>Teaching Method</h2>
    <div class="narrow">
      <p>I tailor my lessons directly to what my student needs, working on both developing technique and a repertoire of songs that the student wants to learn.</p>
      <p>For singing, I use an experience-tested method to get students to freely express their natural voice, while developing solid technique, resonance, projection, diction, and range.</p>
