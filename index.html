    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <div class="narrow">
      <p>I tailor my lessons to the student, working on both technique and songs that the student wants to learn.</p>
      <p>My singing lessons utilize a natural, easy-to-understand, experience-based holistic and scientific method. The aim is to freely express the natural and style-free voice, which can be consciously applied to any musical style. Sing with ease, energized and flowing breath, solid technique, resonance, projection, diction, range and poise. No previous experience is necessary. Adults and children of all ages, voice types, backgrounds and levels from beginner to professional are welcome.</p>

      <h3>Voice Lessons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <blockquote>Whether breathing, posture, legato, tone, control, phrasing or otherwise, Bulent is remarkably attentive, engaging and effective.</blockquote>
          <cite>Jack Volpe</cite>
        </li>
        <li>
          <blockquote>Over the past 6 years, I have performed more than 600 concerts worldwide. Bulent helped me to lay the groundwork for a voice that is well-prepared to take on the rigors of the road as well as the discipline to expect the best out of myself each night. From warming up and warming down, to lifestyle and technique, Bulent's instruction has encouraged, motivated, and prepared me to maximize my singing career.</blockquote>
          <cite>Jon Ricci, lead singer of Lansdowne</cite>
        </li>
        <li>
          <blockquote>Bulent is a great teacher. He is very patient and consistent, and he is willing to work with you at whatever level you are... In one lesson, I was able to fix a sound problem that I had, and had instant results.</blockquote>

      <h3>Piano Lessons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <blockquote>Aside from his technical expertise, I think that one of the greatest things he gives his students is hope. I'm playing again, I'm practicing again. Sitting at the piano has become both easy and fun, not a chore... Bulent is a fantastic music educator because he is neither too easy, nor too critical. He is pleasant, inspiring and meticulous.</blockquote>
          <cite>Lis A.</cite>
        </li>
        <li>
        <blockquote>One of my daughters worked with Bulent on piano and enjoyed every minute. She looked forward to every lesson and felt compelled to learn more. Bulent always went above and beyond, working on technique and voice... Bulent gave her the confidence through trust and play to feel comfortable with performing.</blockquote>
