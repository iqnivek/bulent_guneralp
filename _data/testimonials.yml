voice:

  - quote: "Over the past 6 years, I have performed more than 600 concerts worldwide. Bulent helped me to lay the groundwork for a voice that is well-prepared to take on the rigors of the road as well as the discipline to expect the best out of myself each night. From warming up and warming down, to lifestyle and technique, Bulent's instruction has encouraged, motivated, and prepared me to maximize my singing career."

  - quote: "What can I say about Bulent... As a tenor I had no idea how to sing the high notes. When I sang, they used to come out, but sounded tight, so I never got a part in an opera. Well, just in one lesson I vocalized to a high C with the knowledge he gave me. I actually, for the first time, knew how I did it. It was incredible. I was so happy that for the first time in years of voice training in upstate New York, 10 years in Manhattan New York City, studying with teachers that sang at New York City Opera and the Metropolitan Opera Company, and not one of them, was able to teach me what Bulent taught me in one lesson. He is very clear in his teachings. He taught me how to breathe and use my abdominal muscles. AMAZING. I'm so excited to have found Bulent. I've never given up on my dream, at times I wanted to, but now Bulent has given me a new hope that hopefully within a year I can actually audition for a part in a opera. Now I can actually call myself a tenor. A dream come true. Thank You, Bulent."

  - quote: "Bulent is an exceptional and unique teacher. Blending great clarity, passion, knowledge and warmth, he has provided me with the tools to dramatically enhance my vocal talents. Whether breathing, posture, legato, tone, control, phrasing or otherwise, Bulent is remarkably attentive, engaging and effective. As layers of insight and achievement are unlocked, his vocal wisdom and musicianship contributes to my ever-deepening understanding. In a profound way, Bulent teaches me to 'not-do', to get out of the way and let my body do what it naturally wants to do; although this may sound like a blithe Zen epiphany it is anything but &hellip; it requires extensive explanations and refined explanations, often attempting one sound many dozens of times before the smallest breakthrough. It requires great patience and caring on the part of the teacher. I unequivocally recommend Bulent and earnestly thank him."

  - quote: "Bulent is a great teacher. He is very patient and consistent, and he is willing to work with you at whatever level you are. Bulent has made me love singing even more and appreciate the hard work that singing requires, and appreciate the wonderful sound created due to hard work. In one lesson, I was able to fix a sound problem that I had, and had instant results. I recommend Bulent for those looking to improve on their singing, breath control, and who are very passionate about singing."

  - quote: "I have been taking lessons from Bulent for about a year and it has been the most pleasurable experience I have had singing in a long time. From my very first lesson with Bulent I came away with more confidence in my singing than I had in a long time. I took lessons throughout my life but none were as successful for me as my experience with Bulent. He is very patient and fun to work with. He taught me breathing, singing scales, other exercises that I have been doing for many years without realizing the full benefit of them. I have felt much more confident in singing in the chorus I belong to and have had compliments from other singers as well as the director on the strength of my voice! These compliments have obviously made me feel good and encouraged me to sing out and not be afraid of making mistakes; we all do sometimes and it's not the worst thing to happen. I continue taking lessons with Bulent and learn something new everyday about singing, how to breathe, etc. I would recommend Bulent to anyone (young or old) interested in learning the basics of singing as well as any professional needing a bit of refreshing. Bulent shows a great interest in what he is teaching and that can only transfer to the student in a good way."

  - quote: "I am a singer / songwriter and I have been studying voice with Bulent for 6 years. I was an extremely anxious and unskilled performer when I started. I lacked confidence, my pronunciation was terrible and I had no idea how to style my writing vocally. Bulent is very thorough with the basics - body posture, breathing, focus. As time goes on and you get better vocally, he also works on performance skills and style. He is an excellent performer himself and knows what it takes to perform in different genres whether it's opera, rock, pop or musical theater. He is also phenomenal at pronunciation training. Especially in regard to the English repertoire, I believe he is way better than any native voice teachers, because he had to go through this training himself to perform in operas and musicals. After a couple of years of practicing I started gaining confidence and getting positive feedback from people on my performances. I gained a crucial understanding on how to make a song work lyrically and vocally in an artistic way. My training with Bulent transformed the way I view music and performance. I have had some voice coaches before I met Bulent, but I decided to stay with him, because he is very focused, attentive, skilled and on point EVERY time we have a lesson. He is also a very nice person, always smiling and polite - a rare individual in the music scene. I highly recommend him."

  - quote: "My daughter has been a student of Bulent's for the past four and a half years. During this time, she has developed from a shy six year old to a confident eleven year old, who has no problem performing solos on stage in front of an audience. In fact, she has won talent competitions performing songs that Bulent has taught her. With Bulent's never ending patience, and kind manner she continues to perfect and expand her musical repertoire. Bulent is a master in his craft, who takes great pleasure in sharing his knowledge and love of music. He starts each lesson with breathing techniques, and stretches. He is very careful to teach how not to damage the vocal cords. Bulent is very encouraging, and motivates my daughter to try new approaches to singing. My daughter is very proud to be able to sing in Italian, and is looking forward to working on a German song soon. Bulent is also very accommodating and willing to work around schedules. I would highly recommend Bulent Guneralp."

  - quote: "I've started out my formal vocal training with Bulent from scratch just a little over a year ago. In just 8 months I've started out participating in professional opera productions, such as Commonwealth lyric theater, Lowell House Opera, etc. What attracted me the most was the discipline, structure and passion that are always present in Bulent's teaching approach. He helped me to discover my operatic voice, helped to strengthen it and find ways to make it more like belcanto style. Through the solid groundwork and constant encouragement, he taught me how to breathe, how to use diaphragm muscles, how to avoid tension in vocal chords. Bulent radically changed my perception on what human voice is, and how it's connected with body, mind, and overall well-being."

  - quote: "I wanted to see if an old dog could learn some new tricks. With an open mind but a creaky voice, I sought help from Bulent in hopes of improving my singing voice so that I could better enjoy the choral group in which I was singing. I spent about 1 year studying with Bulent and found that he helped me immensely - both in terms of vocal quality but also in terms of nurturing a better understanding of the relationships between breathing, muscle tone and a visualization of what was actually happening inside my head as sound is produced. While my range is still limited, he managed to improve both my singing and speaking voice. Bulent has a wonderful presence in terms of understanding the material in front of him -- whether it be an old dog like me or a young person with brimming talent -- and adapting his own style to that person. The effect is that he is working with you on your team rather than imposing a moral order that one most obey. I highly recommend Bulent as a voice teacher."

piano:

  - quote: "As adults, how many times have we said 'I used to play the piano'? I wanted to play piano again, but had been unable to find a teacher who met my needs as an adult learner. Then I found Bulent Guneralp. He answered my inquiry in a timely manner. We set up the first lesson and then I looked forward to the second lesson. I am now taking piano lessons weekly. Aside from his technical expertise, I think that one of the greatest things he gives his students is hope. I'm playing again, I'm practicing again. Sitting at the piano has become both easy and fun, not a chore. Maybe because I am a teacher (of a different subject), I know what good teaching is about. Bulent is a fantastic music educator because he is neither too easy, nor too critical. He is pleasant, inspiring and meticulous. Most of all, I am hopeful about taking piano lessons again."
    cite: "Lis A."

  - quote: "One of my daughters worked with Bulent on piano and enjoyed every minute. She looked forward to every lesson and felt compelled to learn more. Bulent always went above and beyond, working on technique and voice. Voice was an unexpected but terrific benefit for my daughter. Bulent gave her the confidence through trust and play to feel comfortable with performing. As a teacher, he was unable to turn away an eager child. He pleasantly allowed my other daughter to sit in and work with her sister, always kind, encouraging and professional. It was a pleasure having my children work with Bulent and I would happily recommend his expertise to those who are interested."

  - quote: "Bulent is a fun loving teacher who loves music, and is wonderful with children of all ages. He has taught our daughter for both voice and piano lessons and our son for drum lessons. His technical knowledge is wonderful, he is exact with the students in regard to technique, breathing and stretching exercises, and body alignment. His lessons are fun and he is full of enthusiasm which rubs off on the students. He helps make younger students feel at ease, and has a gentle manner which makes lessons very enjoyable. We would recommend Bulent to anyone, regardless of musical ability."

  - quote: "Bulent is an excellent, outstanding instructor with the personality to match. He is enthusiastic, competent, patient and attentive. My child was playing a song the first day there. He goes over and above. I myself enjoy sitting in on the classes. Even though this is very educational, they still find time to get to know each other and have a little fun. We HIGHLY recommend him. If you are lucky enough to have Bulent as an instructor, you will not be disappointed. He is also readily available any time you have a question. In our opinion, he is one in a million and we are very, very satisfied and grateful."

  - quote: "I've been taking piano lessons with Bulent for over 2 months now and he's been fantastic! He really teaches how to play with a lot of feel for the music and helps hone your intuition for how a piece should sound. He's very precise and is great at identifying areas for you to develop skills on, or what things to practice etc."
