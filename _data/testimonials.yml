From my very first lesson with Bulent I came away with more confidence in my singing than I had in a long time. I took lessons throughout my life but none were as successful for me as my experience with Bulent. He is very patient and fun to work with. He taught me breathing, singing scales, other exercises that I have been doing for many years without realizing the full benefit of them. I have felt much more confident in singing in the chorus I belong to and have had compliments from other singers as well as the director on the strength of my voice! These compliments have obviously made me feel good and encouraged me to sing out and not be afraid of making mistakes; we all do sometimes and it's not the worst thing to happen. I continue taking lessons with Bulent and learn something new everyday about singing, how to breathe, etc. I would recommend Bulent to anyone (young or old) interested in learning the basics of singing as well as any professional needing a bit of refreshing. Bulent shows a great interest in what he is teaching and that can only transfer to the student in a good way."

- quote: "I am a singer / songwriter and I have been studying voice with Bulent for 6 years. I was an extremely anxious and unskilled performer when I started. I lacked confidence, my pronunciation was terrible and I had no idea how to style my writing vocally. Bulent is very thorough with the basics - body posture, breathing, focus. As time goes on and you get better vocally, he also works on performance skills and style. He is an excellent performer himself and knows what it takes to perform in different genres whether it's opera, rock, pop or musical theater. He is also phenomenal at pronunciation training. Especially in regard to the English repertoire, I believe he is way better than any native voice teachers, because he had to go through this training himself to perform in operas and musicals. After a couple of years of practicing I started gaining confidence and getting positive feedback from people on my performances. I gained a crucial understanding on how to make a song work lyrically and vocally in an artistic way. My training with Bulent transformed the way I view music and performance. I have had some voice coaches before I met Bulent, but I decided to stay with him, because he is very focused, attentive, skilled and on point EVERY time we have a lesson. He is also a very nice person, always smiling and polite - a rare individual in the music scene. I highly recommend him."
